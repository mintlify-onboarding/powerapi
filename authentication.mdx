### Using Email and Password

You can generate an access token for our API using your email and password, with the following endpoint.

  <Card title="Create an access token" icon="square" iconType="duotone" color="#00a400" href="api-reference/get-api-v-1-users-me">
  </Card>

The endpoint will return an access token that can be used to authenticate with our API, using the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

Email & password is the easiest way to authenticate with the API programmatically. However, for testing you can use the authentication widget below to log in and generate a token, this internally uses the same endpoint as above.
